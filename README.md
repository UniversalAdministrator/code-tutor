# Ok Google, Talk to Code Tutor

[![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.io/hchiam/code-tutor.svg)](http://hits.dwyl.io/hchiam/code-tutor)

Let's help people who can't use their hands to learn to code by talking to the Google Assistant.

Built using lessons learned from my [mental-temp-converter backend](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/mental-temp-converter) and a [Zeitspace workshop](https://github.com/zeitspace/AssistantAppWorkshop) I attended.

`index.js` is my inline editor code, which requires the imports listed in `package.json` (you’ll see a tab for it in the inline editor). `CodeTutor.zip` contains my app’s intents, entities, and other app info.

## Previous work:

* https://glitch.com/edit/#!/code-tutor (I started coding directly in Dialogflow' inline editor instead)
* [Mental Temperature Converter app](https://github.com/hchiam/mental-temperature-converter) for the Google Assistant
* [LUI](https://github.com/hchiam/language-user-interface)'s programming add-on
* [Please](https://github.com/hchiam/please), an experimental programming language
* My [programmingByVoice](https://github.com/hchiam/programmingByVoice) web interface
* [How](https://github.com/hchiam/how), an interactive programming test
